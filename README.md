# Restaurant
This app was made wit the MVC (Model View Controller) in that way to understand how the layers interact with each other and how are they important for one and other. We could see the waitress would be de controller because she take the order, the request. Then it goes to the manager who is in charge of spliting the orders just like a service and then the chefs will make the response, the final result, just like a repository.
